The main script is main.m. Execute its numerous sections to setup, estimate and plot results. Various options are for the experiments are available as commented out code in the main script...

The code relies heavily on variables defined in the workspace... I apologize.

utils/initSetups.m sets up some variables that are used in the scripts.

The scripts/ directory has potentially useful scripts (and functions lol)


TODO startup file?

Feel free to reach me if you have any questions:

A summary/report documenting the more important findings with this codebase is at summary.pdf TODO make this happen 

tests/testCorrBtwnTraj.m might be useful as noted in the summary/report.

A toy experiment with the Extended Kalman Filter




The main experiment is with a 2-link planar manipulator. See main.m.
Note: Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox needs to be initialized in order to run the
experiment.
